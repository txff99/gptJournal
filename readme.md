# long term memory helper

this is a tool that helps llm to have long term memory. 
By "long term", it means the tool can retrieve relevant content from the very past history, which helps the llm to recall.

## design
1. once the sentence is prompted into llm, it will be matched in the vector database with the most relevant content and be retrieved.

## TODO
1. enable pipe on data encoding/data storage/data retrieval
2. deploy llm(optional)
